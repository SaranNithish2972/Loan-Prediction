# Loan Prediction Analysis
This is an Analyis based on the target variable Loan_Status (Y or N). The data is preprocessed and EDA is performed. Here different algorithms such as <b>DecisionTreeClassifier</b>, <b>RandomForestClassifier</b> and <b>Logistic Regression</b> are used.<br>
<h4>Outcome:</h4>
<p>There is a positive relationship between applicant income & loan amount. There is also a positive relationship between credit history and loan status. On average, men got more loans. Being married & educated (graduate) were also factors that resulted in loan approvals. For our Machine Learning model, at 84.7% accuracy(20% train data), the Logistic Regression model is the most suitable to make this prediction. For our model, at 83.6% accuracy(40% train data), the Logistic Regression model is the most suitable to make this prediction.</p>
